								<h3>Passmen City</h3>
								<p align="justify">A Unity3D simulator where you can see the interaction between various types of agents, such as pedestrians 
								or cars, in a procedurally generated city. The main idea of the project was to apply various AI techniques that are 
								very common in modern games, such as pathfinding algorithms to move the agents around the map or finite state machines to 
								program a basic agent behaviour. <br/><br/>
								In this project, I worked on a flocking system to simulate a pedestrian crowd and also with
								a machine learning algorithm using neural networks to make the pedestrians learn how to cross the street properly without dying.

								<h3>AI vs Dungeon</h3>
								<p align="justify">What if you could train your own agents to perform intelligent actions in your game? 
								What if your agents could learn from mistakes and improve on their own? <br/><br/>
								This project is a perfect example to show this. I developed a game simulator in Unreal Engine 4, 
								where an AI agent has to solve a 2D platformer level by using his own senses and self-learning by experience. 
								The agent is evolved through genetic algorithms and managed by a neural network, which tells the agent what 
								actions to perform depending on de surrounding environment and the nearest threats.

								<h3>The Boom Box</h3>
								<p align="justify">This is a multiplayer game project and multiplatform (Windows and MacOS) that uses TCP and UDP 
								connections to work. The game consists on a catch game. One of the players will start with a bomb and will have to 
								catch another player before the time runs out or he will be disqualified, and the last man standing wins the game. <br/><br/>
								The game is using SFML (for the graphics rendering and networking), Box2D (for the collision and physics) and SFGUI (for the basic GUI of the game)

								<h3>Westernland: Dust to dust</h3>
								<p align="justify">A third person shooter game made by students of ESAT in his last year of the career. 
								The game demo was developed by a team of 5 programmers and 4 artists using Unreal Engine 4.<br/><br/>
								In the project I was in charge of developing the main AI behaviour of the enemies and the level bosses, 
								also integrating animations, developing the state machines of each enemy character and testing and helping 
								to solve some minor bugs at the final phase of the project.
